# eCommerce Terminologies

Entering the eCommerce development world can be overwhelming due to the sheer number of terminologies and concepts you'll need to grasp. Here's a list of must-know eCommerce terminologies for you.

## General eCommerce Terms

- Shopping Cart: A software component that allows customers to select and store products for purchase.

- Checkout: The process where customers finalize their purchases, provide shipping information, and make payments.

- Order Management System (OMS): Software that tracks sales, orders, inventory, and fulfillment.

- Content Management System (CMS): A software used to create, manage, and modify digital content on a website without needing specialized technical knowledge.

- Product Information Management (PIM): A system used to manage product data and ensure it's consistent across all platforms.

- Customer Relationship Management (CRM): A system for managing a company’s interactions with current and future customers.

- Sales channel refers to a configured pathway through which a business can sell its products or services. It allows businesses to manage multiple selling platforms, such as different storefronts, marketplaces, and social media shops, from a single backend.

Example: A company using Shopware can set up a primary online store for their general customers and a separate storefront for their B2B clients, each with its own pricing, product catalog, and branding, all managed through the same Shopware installation.

- Customer Group refers to a classification that allows businesses to segment their customers into different categories based on specific criteria such as pricing, discounts, access to products, and other custom settings. This segmentation helps in providing tailored shopping experiences, targeted marketing, and personalized pricing.

Example: A business using Shopware might have different customer groups such as "Retail Customers," "Wholesale Customers," and "VIP Customers." Each group can have different price levels, access to special promotions, and exclusive products. For instance, "Wholesale Customers" might receive bulk pricing discounts, while "VIP Customers" might get early access to new products and additional discounts.

- Delivery Times refer to the estimated time frames within which customers can expect their orders to be delivered. These times are displayed on product pages and during the checkout process, helping customers make informed purchasing decisions based on when they need the products.

Example: In Shopware, a product can have a delivery time of "2-3 business days" for domestic shipping and "5-7 business days" for international shipping. This information is shown on the product page and during checkout, so if a customer selects standard shipping for an item with a "2-3 business days" delivery time, they know approximately when to expect their order.

- Number ranges refer to the sequences used to automatically generate unique identifiers for various entities within the system, such as orders, invoices, customers, and products. These number ranges ensure that each identifier is unique and sequential, helping in the organization and tracking of records.

Example In Shopware, you can set up a number range for order IDs starting from "10000". When a new order is placed, it might receive the ID "10001", the next order "10002", and so on. This helps in keeping track of orders in a systematic and easy-to-reference manner. Similarly, you could have a number range for customer IDs starting from "C0001", making each customer’s ID unique and easily identifiable.

- Rule refer to configurable conditions that determine the behavior of various system functionalities. These rules allow businesses to create custom scenarios for pricing, promotions, shipping, taxes, and other operational aspects based on specific criteria.

Example: A rule can be created in Shopware to offer a 10% discount on all orders over $100. The conditions for this rule could be:

Condition: Order total is greater than or equal to $100.
Action: Apply a 10% discount to the total order value.
When a customer’s cart meets this condition, the rule is triggered, and the discount is automatically applied during the checkout process. This allows for flexible and dynamic management of promotions and other business logic.

- Sitemap refers to a structured list of all the pages on a website, designed to help search engines like Google understand the site's structure and index its content more effectively. A sitemap ensures that all pages, including those deep within the site hierarchy, are discoverable by search engines, thereby improving the site’s SEO.

Example: In Shopware, generating a sitemap will include URLs for various pages such as the homepage, category pages, product pages, blog posts, and any other content pages. For instance, a sitemap might contain entries like:

- `https://www.example.com/` (homepage)
- `https://www.example.com/category/electronics` (category page)
- `https://www.example.com/product/laptop` (product page)
- `https://www.example.com/blog/how-to-choose-a-laptop` (blog post)

These URLs are compiled into an XML file that can be submitted to search engines to facilitate better crawling and indexing of the site.

- Cross selling refers to a sales technique where additional or related products are suggested to customers based on their current selections or purchases. This strategy aims to encourage customers to add more items to their cart, increasing the average order value and enhancing the shopping experience.

- Dynamic Product Groups are product groups that are automatically generated groups of products that meet specific criteria defined by the store administrator. These groups update dynamically based on product attributes, categories, or other conditions, ensuring that the product selection remains relevant and up-to-date without manual intervention.

## Products and Catalogues

Catalogues refers to the structured collection of products available for sale within the eCommerce platform. It encompasses all products, their descriptions, prices, categories, and attributes that are managed and displayed to customers for browsing and purchasing.

- Product Listings: Includes details such as product names, descriptions, images, and prices.

- Category Organization: Products are organized into categories (e.g., electronics, clothing) for easier navigation.

- Attributes: Additional details like sizes, colors, and specifications are included to inform customer choices.

- Categories refer to organized grouping of products or services into specific sections within a product catalog. Shopware allows you to create a hierarchical structure of categories and subcategories, making it easier to manage and display products logically. For example, a primary category like "Electronics" can have subcategories like "Mobile Phones," "Laptops," and "Accessories."

## Payment and Security

- Payment Gateway: A service that authorizes and processes credit card or direct payments for eCommerce.

- SSL (Secure Socket Layer): A security protocol that establishes encrypted links between a web server and a browser.

- PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard): Security standards designed to protect card information during and after a financial transaction.

- Tokenization: The process of substituting sensitive data with unique identification symbols (tokens) that retain essential information without compromising security.

## Marketing and Sales

- SEO (Search Engine Optimization): Techniques used to improve a website’s visibility in search engine results.

- PPC (Pay-Per-Click): An online advertising model where advertisers pay each time a user clicks on one of their ads.

- Conversion Rate: The percentage of visitors to a website who complete a desired action (e.g., make a purchase).

- A/B Testing: A method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better.

## User Experience (UX) and Interface

- Accessibility: Ensuring websites and applications can be used by as many people as possible, including those with disabilities.

## Logistics and Fulfillment

- Inventory Management: The supervision of non-capitalized assets (inventory) and stock items.

- Dropshipping: A retail fulfillment method where a store doesn't keep the products it sells in stock. Instead, it purchases the item from a third party and ships it directly to the customer.

- SKU (Stock Keeping Unit): A unique identifier for each product and service that can be purchased.

## Analytics and Data

- Analytics: The discovery, interpretation, and communication of meaningful patterns in data. In eCommerce, it often refers to web analytics, which track and report website traffic.

- Big Data: Large sets of data that can be analyzed to reveal patterns, trends, and associations, particularly relating to human behavior and interactions.
