# What is ecommerce?

**eCommerce**, short for electronic commerce, involves the buying and selling, goods or services over the internet. This broad term encompasses various activities, such as online retail shopping, digital payments, internet banking, online auctions, electronic ticketing for events, and more. eCommerce leverages technologies like mobile commerce (mCommerce), electronic funds transfer (EFT), supply chain management, internet marketing, online transaction processing, inventory management systems, and automated data collection systems. By facilitating seamless and efficient transactions across the globe, eCommerce has revolutionized traditional commerce practices, making it easier for businesses and consumers to interact and conduct business online.
