# Why you should app ?

The introduction of Shopware apps has revolutionized the landscape for merchants and agencies alike. Traditionally, creating extensions tailored to specific shops or small client groups meant developing plugins, standard practice within the Shopware ecosystem. However, with the advent of the app system, new possibilities have emerged beyond plugins.

Choosing apps over plugins for extending your Shopware store can offer several advantages:

1. Ease of Integration and Management: Apps often integrate more seamlessly with Shopware's cloud infrastructure, offering streamlined management and updates. This means fewer headaches with compatibility and maintenance compared to traditional plugins.
2. Enhanced Customization with App Scripting: App Scripting allows you to write custom logic directly within the app using Twig. This makes it easier to modify or add features without needing extensive backend changes, simplifying development and customization.
3. Cloud Benefits: Cloud Platforms provide benefits such as scalability, stability, and reduced need for self-managed infrastructure. Apps are designed to leverage these cloud advantages, offering a more modern and flexible approach compared to plugins that might rely on traditional, self-managed setups.
4. Private Apps for Deeper Customization: Private Apps in the Shopware cloud environment offer greater flexibility for specialized customization. You can tailor these apps specifically to your store’s needs, going beyond the standard functionalities available in plugins.
5. Seamless Updates and Upgrades: Apps benefit from Shopware’s cloud infrastructure, making it easier to receive updates and upgrades automatically. This ensures that your custom features stay compatible with the latest Shopware versions with minimal effort.
6. Simplified Infrastructure: App Architecture often reduces the need for complex backend setups. Many apps work within the Shopware cloud environment, handling necessary infrastructure and making it easier to implement and manage new features.
7. Future-Proofing: Shopware’s Evolution is increasingly centered around apps. By adopting apps now, you align with the platform's future direction, gaining access to cutting-edge features and improvements that may not be available with traditional plugins.

For those interested in exploring these advancements, diving into the documentation on app scripting, private apps, and custom entities is recommended to unlock the full potential of Shopware's app-driven future.
