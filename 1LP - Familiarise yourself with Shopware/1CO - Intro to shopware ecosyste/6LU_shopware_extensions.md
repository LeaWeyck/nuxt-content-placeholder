# Shopware Extensions

Shopware extensions are like extra tools or features that you can add to an online store built with Shopware, which is a platform for creating and managing e-commerce websites. Imagine you have a basic store, and you want to add something special to it, like a tool that helps with sending emails to customers, a way to offer discounts, or an option for customers to pay with different methods. Instead of building these features from scratch, you can just install an extension that does what you need.

Extensions are like apps on your phone; they make your store more powerful by adding specific functions or improving how it works. You can find a wide variety of these extensions in the [Shopware marketplace](https://store.shopware.com/en/), and they help store owners customize their shops according to their needs without needing to know how to code.

From a developer's perspective, extensions help extend the core capabilities of Shopware without altering the core codebase directly. Extensions can be broadly categorized into:

1. **Apps**
2. **Themes**
