# Shopware, an Opensource platform

Shopware is an open-source eCommerce platform designed for businesses of all sizes, offering flexibility and scalability to create customized online stores. As an open-source solution, it provides access to its source code, allowing developers to tailor the platform to specific business needs, lets users freely inspect, modify, and enhance it per its licensing agreement. On the other hand, there is proprietary software that is copyrighted property of an individual or company that limits its use, distribution, and modification by way of a proprietary license.

Take a closer look at the differences for better understanding.

## Opensource vs Properaitory

| Topic | Open source software | Proprietary software |
|-------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Development | Community based | Closed-source, usually by a professional team |
| Licensing | Permissive, allowing some level of modification and distribution | Restrictive, usually forbidding modification and distribution |
| Security | Dependent upon open-source community participation and upkeep | Usually company-driven and requires professional development resources |
| Flexibility | Significant flexibility with the freedom to inspect and modify OSS | A more-restrictive license generally prevents inspecting and modifying code |
| Maintenance | Community-driven across the software’s lifetime per the community’s priorities (with bug fixes potentially being provided by only a handful of dedicated community members) | Provided by the software’s publisher across its lifetime in response to customer needs and market conditions |
| Support | Not provided as a service, and generally requires independently checking the documentation or crowdsourcing across the community | Provided by the software’s publisher in direct response to customer needs |
| Cost to Use | OSS generally has no initial fee, except if they have commercila plans. Over time, relying on OSS may incur ongoing costs in developer maintenance. | Typically requires purchase/subscription, particularly for commercial apps |
| Ease of Use | Getting started working with a new OSS project for the first time may depend entirely on how much clear community documentation is available for beginners | Particularly in the case of commercial products, software vendors are incentivized to focus on usability, as user-friendly software will encourage continued use |
| Functioality | OSP are like "white box" core in which integrations and customizations are easilyconfigured. |Closed platforms offer a “black box” core in which integrations and limited customization are possible through rigid configuration and predefined extension points.

 Hence, Shopware, an open source code and its inherent collaborative culture allows merchants to build the exact experience their customers and teams need – without limitation. Literally everything is open for customization, extension, and integration. This is significant to merchants who must differentiate themselves from their competitors, deliver insightful & authentic experiences for their customers, and innovate their way to be future-proof.
