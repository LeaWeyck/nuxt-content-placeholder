# Shopware distribution models

Shopware provides self-hosted, SaaS and PaaS models.

- **On-premise** : A self-hosted solution offers several advantages. It allows merchants to use the system without requiring a disruptive overhaul, while giving the retail organization control over its own hardware, software, and customer data. Additionally, on-premise setups are often seen as a more cost-effective option. 

However, managing all aspects of infrastructure and software demands significant internal expertise, and finding employees with the right technical skills can be challenging. Self-hosted solutions also traditionally face difficulties when it comes to scaling infrastructure.

Merchants can opt to purchase a license for an open-source platform and utilize a hosting service or cloud infrastructure, which provides greater flexibility. This adaptability in hosting can be used to integrate a digital sales room, enhancing the customer experience with interactive features and avoiding reliance on a single server location.

For businesses that prefer not to stick with self-hosted solutions, there are alternatives such as Software as a Service (SaaS) or Platform as a Service (PaaS).

- **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)** : SaaS is an ideal choice for organizations that prefer minimal involvement in software management and seek a quick, 'out of the box' solution. The vendor takes care of everything, from the software applications to data management, with automated updates.

This option is particularly safe for businesses that lack the resources to manage software installations and updates, though it does come with limitations in terms of customization.

- **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)** : PaaS offers a more flexible option, combining the convenience of a service model with greater adaptability. By sourcing both hosting and software from a single provider, customers can enjoy benefits like top-tier security and scalability, while also retaining more control over their data and applicationsâ€”similar to a self-hosted solution.

While PaaS doesn't include the automatic updates provided by SaaS, requiring users to manage their own updates, this trade-off allows for a higher level of customization. The managed infrastructure enables teams to concentrate on developing eCommerce systems that deliver an outstanding customer experience.

So based on the available models, TekUniverse chooses on-premise services. Alright, now with these requirements fulfilled, lets see if there are any custom requiments from the TekUniverse. If there are any customizations required, then Shopware also offers this easily with extensions. Lets know more about this in our next unit.
