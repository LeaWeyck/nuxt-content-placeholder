### Entering prices / pricing

* pricing is important
* everybody expects cheap prices on the internet
* but this might be coherent to how your products are well-presented or if you just make use of specifications
* pricing in B2B may behave different as there is not VAT included
* please note that there are services to scrape your prices from your internet store and make them offer for someat less by your competitors/foes
* using Shopware, you might enter different prices for a product, like 
    * regular price
    * reduced price in comprehansion to 30 days before
    * bulk prices
    * prices per unit (explain!)

### images

* product images are super important for product presentation!
* prospect clients will love to see every angle of the product!
* Shopware allowes you to upload [TBD] images per product
* consider to use zoom to your product images
* consider to use 360Â°images of your product images

### dimensions vs. weight

* for avarage products, enter a weight to it so you can configure shipping costs via the Rule Builder implemented into Shopware
* it gets more complex when a product has less weight then it is big: Carrier rules.
* Also this, can be applicated with the rule builder when it comes towards you have to ship a cradle of feathers which is no weight against its real measures.
* In this case, L x W x H devided by 6000 (dev by 5000 for international shipment) comes into the game.
