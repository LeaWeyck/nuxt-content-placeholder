### Useful hints

Here are some more hints to make the most out of your project when entering products:

Please have in mind that the product title will have a big influence on your SEO visibility as it automatically creates the page title and (in most cases, depending on your SEO configuration) will influence the final URI of the PDP.

Of course your product will have some technical specifications like color, fabric, performance, whatever. Please do not rely on these specifications alone. Instead, take the trouble yourself to write a meaningful and comprehensive description.

To stick with my former example: 

> Transform your summerhouse into a serene and elegant retreat with our exquisite decorative fabric. Perfect for use as drapes, this lightweight material exudes sophistication and charm, making it an ideal choice for your seasonal abode.

> The fabric features a delightful summer floral pattern, bringing a touch of nature's beauty indoors. Its delicate translucence allows sunlight to gently filter through, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The light, airy drape ensures the fabric falls gracefully, adding an effortless elegance to any room.

> Whether you're looking to refresh your space or create a cohesive, summery aesthetic, our luxurious decorative fabric is the perfect solution. Embrace the season's splendor and let your home bask in the gentle glow of summer.

This is not only important for your SEO visibility but also a good read for your prospect client, is it not?

By the way, in the paid plans, Shopware supports you with the AI creation of these texts. But be careful with it and always check if the facts are right. Also, give it a copy edit and try to make it sound more human, even if you use any AI manually. The example above is a bit "flowery" isn't it ;)
