## The catalog part of an online shop

When looking at the storefront of a shopping cart system, each and everyone consists of different parts:

You will definitely see a start (home) page, where you may find basic information about the range of sold products, maybe some words about the company, teaser banners, and of course, marketing campaigns for products on sale or other special offers or bargains.

In this manner, this is kind of a landing page where the prospect may get a first impression. With Shopware, it is possible to steer the behaviour of this page, and you can even add additional landing pages to several other sections of your online shop, for example to create different Shopping Worlds.

Digging into the product categories, you will find the so called product listing pages (PLP). This kind of pages displays a list of products within a certain category, based on the user's search request.

Clicking on a certain product leads you to the so called PDP, the product detail page with detailed information about a product in terms of color, size, a detailed description and a set of product images.

All of the above named page styles,

* landing page
* product listing page and
* product detail page

belong to the so called "catalog" part of a classic online shop.

For maintaining the content (product information, prices etc.) there is often another frontend provided, the administration panel. Everything entered there, will be stored in a database and dynamically rendered in the storefront of an online shop in the moment the page is called up in the browser of the user (this is a very simplified picture ;)). In this manner, the catalog area of an online shop is very similar to any CMS (Content Management System).

## Different to a CMS: the Checkout

However, there is always another fundamental part: the Checkout which devites online shops from regular CMSses.

Let's say you decided to buy a product, at least on the PDP, you have this BUY-button, right? Clicking this button will send your product to the shopping cart, where our checkout journey starts. You check the product(s) once again you want to buy, adapt the quantity if necessary, add your postal details and finally go through the payment process of your choosing.
