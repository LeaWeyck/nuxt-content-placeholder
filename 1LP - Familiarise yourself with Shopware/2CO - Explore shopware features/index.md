# Discovering Shopware Features

Welcome to the Shopware exploration journey! You have been granted a 30-day test instance to delve into Shopware's powerful features. Begin by accessing your environment at [Shopware account](https://account.shopware.com). No company affiliation is required to start.

On your Shopware account homepage, navigate to the "More functions in the account" section. Here, you will find a button to create your cloud developer environment. Once initiated, please allow a few minutes for the setup process to complete.

After the environment is ready, a title will appear providing vital information such as the remaining runtime, live status, and URLs for both administration and the storefront.
