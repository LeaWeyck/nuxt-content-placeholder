# Quick note on extending your installation
<!-- own LU in preperation -->

Understanding how to extend the functionality of your Shopware store through extensions is key to tailoring your eCommerce experience to meet specific needs and preferences. Hereâ€™s an overview of the different types of extensions and how to manage them:

## What Are Extensions?

Extensions enhance and customize your Shopware installation, allowing you to add features and modify the appearance of your online store. While some technical knowledge can be helpful in implementing extensions, a wide network of skilled developers offers pre-built solutions. For a comprehensive view of available extensions, you can visit [store.shopware.com](http://store.shopware.com/), which is also a Shopware store itself.

## Types of Extensions

1. **Themes**:
    - Themes primarily affect the storefront of your shop. They are used to alter the visual appearance and user experience of your online store.
    - Unlike apps and plugins, themes do not typically extend the functional capabilities of your shop but focus on its look and feel.
2. **Plugins**:
    - Plugins were traditionally used to extend the functionality of your Shopware installation but are now relevant primarily for the onPremise version of Shopware.
    - They provide various functionalities that enhance or modify how your store operates.
3. **Apps**:
    - Apps represent the newer and recommended type of extension. They are designed to work seamlessly both in the onPremise version and in the cloud.
    - Apps offer a range of functionalities similar to plugins but are more versatile and modern in their integration.

## Rented Extensions and Individual Extensions

- **Rented Extensions**: Most extensions are available for rent, allowing you to use them on a subscription basis. Many free extensions are also available, providing cost-effective options for extending your store's capabilities.
- **Individual Extensions**: Instead of renting, you can opt for custom solutions. This includes bespoke plugins, themes, or private apps tailored to your specific needs. For custom development, consult with the extensive partner network at [Shopware's partner agencies](https://www.shopware.com/en/partner/agencies/) to find the right expertise.

## How to Add Extensions to Your Installation

1. **Using the Extensions Menu**:
    - Navigate to the **Extensions** menu and select **Store**. Here, you first need to activate the store, which might take a few minutes.
    - Once activated, you can browse through an overview of available extensions, filter them based on your needs, and install those that suit your requirements. This provides an alternative to visiting [store.shopware.com](http://store.shopware.com/) directly.
2. **Managing Your Extensions**:
    - Under the **"My Extensions"** section, you can view all installed apps. This overview allows you to check which apps are installed and activated, sort extensions, or hide inactive ones.
    - Use the three dots next to each extension to inspect details, rate, or uninstall as needed.

By understanding and utilizing these extensions effectively, you can significantly enhance the functionality and appearance of your Shopware store, making it better suited to your business needs and customer expectations.
