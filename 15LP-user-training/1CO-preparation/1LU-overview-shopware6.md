## Community Edition
The **Community Edition** is free of charge, and particularly attractive for those who are tech-savvy and capable of managing the technical aspects of their online store without external assistance. However, it is important to note that the Community Edition is only available as a self-hosted distribution. This means that users are responsible for setting up, maintaining, and securing their own hosting environment.

While the Community Edition provides a solid foundation for building an online store, it **does not include the additional features and services offered in the more advanced Rise, Evolve, or Beyond plans**. Specifically, Shopware does not provide product support for the Community Edition, which could be a significant consideration for merchants who anticipate needing professional assistance.

Despite these limitations, you have access to the [Shopware Store](https://store.shopware.com), where you can find a variety of extensions to enhance the functionality of their store. This access allows merchants to tailor their e-commerce platform to better meet their needs, even if they are using the free version.

Overall, the Community Edition serves as a good starting point for merchants who are technically inclined and looking to explore the capabilities of Shopware without any initial financial investment. However, for those who intend to use Shopware in a more professional capacity, transitioning to a commercial plan is strongly recommended. These plans offer additional features, services, and support that can significantly enhance the platform's performance and usability, making them a more suitable choice for serious e-commerce operations.

## Shopware plans

When exploring Shopware plans, you'll find options that cater to various business needs, allowing you to select the plan that best aligns with your goals and operations. Detailed information about these editions is available in Course 4. Let's still cover the three complementing Shopware plans in a nutshell at this point.

The **Rise** plan is designed to help you stand out from the competition by focusing on your brandâ€™s unique identity. With this plan, you can create a distinctive online presence, automate workflows, and present your products in the best possible light. While it offers a sophisticated feature set, it's geared more towards basic needs, with limited B2B functionalities and basic support services.

For businesses looking to accelerate growth, the **Evolve** plan provides the flexibility to experiment and scale according to your ideas. This plan supports both B2C and B2B models with comprehensive capabilities and advanced customer experience features, allowing you to enhance your online presence significantly. It includes an enhanced feature set, B2B functionalities, and advanced support services to meet more demanding needs.

If your goal is to build something extraordinary, the **Beyond** plan is tailored for you. It offers maximum adaptability and next-level customer experiences, supported by premium services. With this plan, you get access to the full range of features and comprehensive support, ensuring your business can achieve exceptional performance.

## Shopware distribution models

Shopware offers two primary distribution models: OnPremise and Cloud, each catering to different needs and preferences regarding flexibility and responsibility.

With the **Self-Hosted** model, Shopware is installed on your own server. This approach provides you with full flexibility to customize and control every aspect of your e-commerce system. However, it also means that you bear full responsibility for managing and maintaining the shop, including handling technical issues and updates.

Conversely, the **Cloud** distribution model simplifies your responsibilities by offloading the technical aspects to Shopware. You can focus on running your business while we manage the hosting and infrastructure. Within the Cloud model, you have two main options: SaaS and PaaS.

**SaaS (Software-as-a-Service)** offers a straightforward and hassle-free solution by hosting the software on our servers. This is ideal for businesses that are starting out or prefer a more managed approach. For more details about SaaS, you can refer to [this documentation](https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-6-en/saas).

**PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service)** provides a more tailored hosting solution that combines the benefits of individualized customization with the convenience of cloud-based infrastructure. This option is best suited for businesses that need a more specific setup while still leveraging cloud technology. To explore PaaS options, please contact our sales department and consult [this documentation](https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-6-en/paas).
