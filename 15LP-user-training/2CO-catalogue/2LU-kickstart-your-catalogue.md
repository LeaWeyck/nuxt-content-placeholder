# Kickstart your catalogue
Let’s now begin structuring your online shop. Having previously covered the administration aspects and successfully created your first product, we are now ready to advance to the next step. In this unit, we will focus on creating your first categories, which are essential for organizing your products and enhancing the shopping experience for your customers.

To illustrate this process, we will use a practical example: setting up a simple online shop for musical instruments. This example will guide you through the process of categorizing products effectively. By the end of this unit, you will have a well-structured shop with clear categories that make it easier for your customers to navigate and find the items they are looking for. So, let’s dive in and get started!

## Creating a category structure

Understanding the role of categories is crucial when structuring your online shop. Categories serve not only to organize your product catalog but also to structure your shop effectively. They are instrumental in arranging all individual pages within your shop, which in turn simplifies the design of your main menu and footer menu. By categorizing your products and pages, you can ensure a coherent and user-friendly navigation experience for your customers.

To explore the categories menu, navigate to the "Catalogues" section and then select "Categories." (A screenshot would be helpful here for reference.) On the left side of the screen, you will find an overview of all categories and landing pages. For now, we will focus on categories and not landing pages. Under the section labeled **My Store**, you will see two key structuring elements: **Home** and **Footer Menu**.

The **Home** category represents the main entry point for the primary navigation of your storefront sales channel. Conversely, the **Footer Menu** is used for organizing the footer navigation. You can compare the sub-categories of the footer menu with the footer section in your storefront to get a clearer idea of their function.

### Creating Your First Category

To create your initial product categories that will appear in the navigation, you need to add sub-categories under the **Home** category. Begin by clicking the three dots next to **Home** and selecting **New Subcategory**. Enter the name of the new category; for instance, type **Guitars**. Pressing Enter will prompt you to add another category on the same level, allowing for efficient category structuring. You can then add another sub-category, such as **Bass**, and finalize by pressing Enter and then Esc. For now, these two categories will suffice.

By default, categories are not activated immediately. To activate them, click on each category individually, hit **Activate**, and then **Save**.

Switch back to the storefront and refresh the page; you should see your newly created categories. However, please note that these categories will be empty until you add products to them.

### Exploring the Category Module

Next, let’s delve into the details of the category module. Click on a category in your administration area to inspect its navigation items. You will find four tabs available for configuration:

1. **General**: This tab includes settings for the category such as:
    - **Name**: The name of the category.
    - **Active**: The activation state, allowing you to work on a category without affecting its visibility to customers.
    - **Tags**: Useful for automation, like tagging categories as “fragile” to enable customized shipping methods.
    - **Category Type**:
        - **Page / List**: A standard category typically used to hold products.
        - **Structuring Element / Entry Point**: This type cannot be entered directly but serves as a structural component.
        - **Link**: Allows redirection to any page within or outside the online shop.
    - **Dynamic Access**: Provides control over who can view the category using the rule builder, which will be discussed in a later section.
    - **Navigation**: Allows selection of different entry points for various sales channels.
    - **Menu Settings**: Offers options to hide a category from navigation while keeping it accessible via link, and allows the addition of a display image and description above the products in a category.
    - **Custom Fields**: Provide additional flexibility, useful for SEO and other custom requirements.
2. **Products**: This tab allows for manual selection of products associated with the category or the use of dynamic product groups, which will be covered later.
3. **Layout**: Lets you choose between different detail layouts for the category. You can configure the layout to suit specific needs, such as showcasing large, emotional images for guitars or focusing on technical details for accessories like guitar strings. Feel free to experiment with different layouts to find what works best for each category.
4. **SEO**: Enables you to define parameters for search engine optimization, including meta titles, descriptions, keywords, and SEO URL configurations. There is also a dedicated SEO training available for further learning.

I recommend exploring the category module’s interface to familiarize yourself with its features. For detailed documentation, you can refer to [our documentation](https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-6-en/catalogues/categories?category=shopware-6-en/catalogues).

### Creating a Complex Navigation Structure

To enhance your navigation structure, you might want to create a more intricate setup. For example:

- Instruments
    - Electric Guitars
        - Telecasters
        - Stratocasters
        - Offset models
        - Miscellaneous Guitars
    - Acoustic Guitars
    - Electric Basses
        - 4-String
        - 5-String
        - Miscellaneous Basses
- Assessories
    - Strings
        - Guitar strings
        - Bass strings
    - Cleaning products

This structured approach helps in organizing products and categories in a way that improves both user navigation and overall shop functionality.
