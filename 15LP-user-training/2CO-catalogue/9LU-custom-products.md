# Explore custom products

<!-- Todo: this is rise! -->

Customization has become a potent tool in commerce, driven by advancements in IT that have led to the rise of mass customization strategies. These strategies blend the efficiency of mass production with the personal touch of custom-made products, allowing businesses to offer personalized items at scale. While product variants already provide a degree of customization, we can further enhance the customer experience with more tailored options. For example, consider offering custom engraving on a guitar's neck joint—a unique way to add individualism to the instrument.

Here’s how you can set up such a customization option:

1. **Define a Custom Products Template**:
    - Navigate to the **Specifications** tab of your product and scroll down to the **Custom Products** section.
    - Click on the link **Custom Products** to enter the module where you'll define your customization options.
    - You'll see an empty list initially. Click **Add template** to create a new one.
    - For the **Technical name**, use **Engraving** and activate it immediately.
    - Set the **Display name** to **Your Custom Engraving**.
    - Write a brief description, such as: **"Give your instrument a personal touch and add a customized engraving to it. This engraving is made by a professional on the metal plate of the neck joint on the back of the guitar."**
    - Optionally, you can upload a picture to illustrate the engraving. You can also explore advanced settings like:
        - **Step-by-step mode** for complex customization options.
        - **Self-collapsing options** to hide choices once selected.
        - **Customer confirmation** to ensure customers review and confirm their customizations before proceeding to checkout. For detailed input like this, activate this feature.
2. **Configure the Customization Option**:
    - Click **Save** to make the **Options** box appear.
    - Click **Add option**, name it **Engraving**, and select **Text field** as the type.
    - You have various options to configure, so feel free to explore them later. For now:
        - Click **Add**, then select your created option **Engravings** from the list.
        - Specify whether customization is required or optional (default is optional).
        - Add a description, such as **"Please use no more than 12 characters."**
        - Define the length constraints: set a minimum of 1 character and a maximum of 12 characters.
        - Set a surcharge: choose the standard rate as the tax rate and set a price of €5.
        - Click **Apply**, then **Save** the template.
3. **Apply the Template to Your Product**:
    - Return to the product’s **Specifications** tab, scroll down, and select the newly created template under **Custom Products**.
    - Click **Save** to apply the template.
4. **View and Test the Customization in the Storefront**:
    - Refresh the Storefront and check the right side of the product page.
    - You should see the engraving option, where customers can add their text. Note that the input field restricts text to no more than 12 characters, as specified.
    - When customers click elsewhere on the screen, the per-unit surcharge should recalculate based on their input.
    - There is also an option to create a shareable link for the custom product configuration.
    - A checkbox for **"I double-checked the configuration and confirm these settings are correct"** allows customers to confirm their customization.

By following these steps, you've successfully created a custom product with personalized options. Feel free to experiment further with this powerful tool to enhance your business offerings and provide a truly customized shopping experience for your customers.
