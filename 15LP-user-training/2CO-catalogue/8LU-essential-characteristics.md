# Explore essential characteristics

As discussed, Essential Characteristics are pivotal in highlighting key product information that appears prominently in your customers' shopping carts and during the checkout process. This feature ensures that important details, like packaging dimensions, are readily available to customers, enhancing their shopping experience.

For instance, a guitar, being a sizable item, necessitates the inclusion of packaging information as Essential Characteristics. To achieve this, follow these steps:

1. **Access the Specifications Tab**:
    - Navigate to the **Specifications** tab within your product in the Administration area.
    - Under **Measures & Packaging**, you have previously defined the package's dimensions and weight.
2. **Create an Essential Characteristics Template**:
    - Scroll down to the **Essential Characteristics** section.
    - You’ll need to create a template here. Click on the **Essential Characteristics** link to enter the module. Alternatively, you can access this under **Settings** and then **Essential Characteristics** as a Shop Setting.
    - You’ll see a list of existing templates, including a predefined one.
    - Click **Create new** to start a new template.
    - Name the template **Packaging Information** and click **Save**.
3. **Add Values to the Template**:
    - With the new template created, click **Add field**.
    - Choose **Product information** and then click **Next**.
    - Check the boxes for Width, Height, Length, and Weight. Click **Add** to include these fields in the template.
    - Click **Cancel** to exit the field selection screen.
    - You can now adjust the order of the values within the template if needed.
4. **Inspect the Results**:
    - Go to your Storefront and add the product to the shopping cart by clicking **Add to shopping cart**.
    - Observe that the cart will pop out from the right-hand side. You should see the packaging information included in the product description within the cart.
    - This information will remain visible to the customer throughout the checkout process and will persist until the invoice stage.

By following these steps, you ensure that essential packaging information is clearly communicated to your customers, thereby enhancing transparency and improving their overall shopping experience.
