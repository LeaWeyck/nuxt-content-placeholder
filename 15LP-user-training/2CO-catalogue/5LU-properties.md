# Define product properties

Let’s now take a quick look at product properties. While the product description plays a crucial role in detailing your product, it’s equally important to clearly state specific properties that can influence a buyer's decision. Buyers often scan these properties when evaluating products, and they are useful for filtering and searching within your catalogue.

Product properties are fundamental to your catalogue and can be managed in a holistic yet flexible manner to fit your business needs. Let’s add a few properties to our catalogue to illustrate this.

### Adding Product Properties

1. **Navigate to Properties**:
    - Go to **Catalogues** and select **Properties**. Initially, you’ll see that no default properties are defined. To create a new property, click **Add Property**.
2. **Define the Property**:
    - **Name**: Enter the name of the property, such as **Body Finish**.
    - **Description**: Although optional, providing a description can clarify the property’s purpose.
    - **Display Options**: Choose whether this property should be displayed in filters and on the detail page.
    - **Value Display Type**: Select how the property values will be displayed. For **Body Finish**, choose **Colour**. The display options are:
        - **Image**: Display an image for each option in filters.
        - **Text**: Display the options as text in filters.
        - **Dropdown**: Show selected property values in a dropdown menu on the product detail page.
        - **Colour**: Highlight the color in the options, displaying it in filters.

    Click **Save** to proceed to defining the property values.

3. **Add Property Values**:
    - Click **Add Value** to enter the first value. For the **Body Finish** property:
        - Name the first value **Red**, set **Position** to **1**, and select a red color.
        - Add another value named **White**, with **Position** set to **2** and a white color.
    - Click **Save** to save these property values.
4. **Add Additional Properties**:
    - Create another property named **Neck Material**. Set the display type to **Text**, and then add the values **Alder** and **Roasted Maple**, saving each one.

### Assigning Properties to a Product

1. **Configure Properties for the Product**:
    - Navigate back to the guitar product you created earlier. Go to the **Specifications** tab and click **Configure Properties**. You should see the newly created properties here.
    - For **Body Finish**, select **Red**.
    - For **Neck Material**, choose **Roasted Maple**.
    - Click **Save** to close the property configuration and then **Save** again to store the updated product.
2. **Inspect in the Storefront**:
    - Refresh your product detail page in the storefront. You should see the product properties displayed clearly below the product description.
    - Navigate to the main category by clicking on **Home**. In the product listing layout, you’ll find filters on the left-hand side. The properties now serve as filter options, with the **Body Finish** filter utilizing the defined color.

Product properties are a valuable tool for clearly describing your products and guiding customers through search and filters. They also become particularly useful in managing product variants, which will be covered in future sections.
