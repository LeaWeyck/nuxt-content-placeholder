# Catalogue Management
Let's delve into the product listing, an essential tool for effectively managing your catalog. The product listing feature is particularly powerful because it provides a robust and flexible interface, allowing you to easily oversee and adjust the products in your catalog.

One of the key strengths of the product listing is its flexibility. This feature enables you to view and manage your entire product range in a streamlined manner, ensuring that you can keep everything organized and up-to-date. Whether you're managing a small catalog or a large inventory, the product listing adapts to your needs, making it easier to handle the complexities of your product offerings.

An integral part of this flexibility lies in the filtering functionality. With filters, you can quickly narrow down your product list to focus on specific items that meet certain criteria, such as categories, stock levels, pricing, or any other attribute you might need to consider. This is particularly useful when you need to make targeted adjustments or analyze specific segments of your catalog.

In addition to filtering, the bulk edit functionality is another critical feature that enhances the efficiency of managing your catalog. Bulk editing allows you to make changes to multiple products simultaneously, saving you significant time and effort. Whether you're updating prices, adjusting descriptions, or modifying product attributes, bulk edits streamline the process, ensuring consistency across your listings and reducing the potential for errors.

Now that we've outlined these capabilities, let's dive into how you can leverage the flexibility of the product listing and utilize both filtering and bulk edit functionalities to optimize your catalog management.

## Product overview

To manage your product listings effectively, start by navigating to **Catalogues → Products**. This section offers a range of functionalities designed to enhance your experience and efficiency in managing products.

### Basic Functionality of the Listing

In the product listing view, you can easily organize and customize the information displayed. By clicking on any column header, you can reorder the products based on that column. If you prefer a cleaner view, certain columns can be hidden by selecting the three dots menu located on the right side of each column header. This menu also offers more configuration options:

- **View Settings**: You can toggle between a compact view, which minimizes the spacing between items, and a normal view, which provides a bit more breathing room between rows.
- **Product Images**: Decide whether or not to display preview images of the products in the listing.
- **Column Visibility**: Select which columns you want to show or hide.
- **Column Order**: Rearrange the order of the columns to suit your preferences.

To dive deeper into a specific product, simply click on its name to enter the product detail page. If a product has variants, this will be indicated by a variants symbol next to the product name. Additionally, double-clicking on a row (anywhere except the product name) will activate the quick edit mode, allowing you to make swift changes without leaving the listing page. If you need to update the page, use the refresh button to reload the data.

### Filtering

The product listing view also offers robust filtering options to help you narrow down your search. You can filter products based on various criteria, including:

- **Active State**: Filter products that are active or inactive.
- **Stock**: Find products based on their stock status.
- **Image Status**: Filter by whether or not the products have images assigned.
- **Manufacturer**: Narrow down products from specific manufacturers.
- **Sales Channel Association**: Filter based on the sales channels associated with the products.
- **Categories**: Choose specific categories to view.
- **Sales**: Filter by sales data.
- **Tags**: Use tags to find products with specific labels.
- **Physical or Digital Products**: Differentiate between physical and digital products.
- **Release Date**: Filter products by their release date.

Once you set a filter, the product listing updates immediately to show only the products that match your criteria. If you want to clear a specific filter, use the “Reset” link next to that filter, and the results will update accordingly. To clear all filters and return to the full list of products, simply click the “Reset all” link.

### Bulk Editing Multiple Products

Bulk editing is a powerful feature that allows you to make changes to multiple products simultaneously. Let’s explore this with a practical example.

Suppose earlier you created two products for guitar strings but forgot to add media to them. To maintain a professional storefront, you want to deactivate these products, add a tag to mark them for review by your marketing team, and place them in the correct category.

Start by using the filter to find these products:

1. Open the filter options.
2. Under **Images**, select **No product images assigned**. The list will update, and only the products without images (in this case, the guitar strings) will remain.

Now, follow these steps to bulk edit the selected products:

- Click the checkbox in the header row to select all items. The number of selected rows will be indicated.
- Click **Bulk edit**. A new window appears, showing the selected products, ensuring you're targeting the correct items.
- Click **Start bulk edit**.
- You’ll be presented with a view where you can alter various aspects of the products, similar to the product detail page.
- To deactivate the products, check the box next to **Change: Active** and ensure the **Active** switch is turned off.
- Scroll down to **Visibility & structure** and check **Change: Tags**. In the dropdown, choose **Add** and enter **marketing-check** as the new tag. This tag will now be added to the selected products.
- Click **Apply changes**. A confirmation dialog will appear, reminding you not to close the browser tab while the bulk edit is processing. This process is quick for a few products, but can take longer for larger quantities. Click **Apply changes** again, and you'll see a processing notification followed by a success confirmation. Click **Close**.

After this process, return to the product overview. You should see that the two products are now deactivated and no longer visible in the Storefront. Marketing can easily find these products using the filter for the **marketing-check** tag.

However, it appears we forgot to place the guitar strings into the **Guitar strings** category. No worries—this can be easily corrected. Simply select the products again and assign them to the correct category through another bulk edit.

By following these steps, you can efficiently manage and organize your products, ensuring that your storefront remains professional and well-maintained.
