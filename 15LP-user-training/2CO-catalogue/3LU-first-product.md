# Create the first simple product

Let’s now dig deeper into the process of creating and managing products, which are, naturally, the central component of your shop. Shopware offers extensive flexibility, allowing you to define every aspect of your products and business in great detail. While this flexibility can be overwhelming at first, we’ll start by creating a simple product with only the minimum required information. In the next learning unit, we will explore the more detailed aspects of product definition.

To get started, navigate to **Catalogues** and then select **Products**. From there, you can add a new product by clicking on **Add Product**.

## Creating Your First Product in Shopware

1. **Add a Product**: Begin by creating a basic product with just the essential information. Choose a field of interest, such as musical instruments for this example. For now, we will only fill out the required fields marked with an asterisk (*).
    - **Name**: Enter a product name, for example, **Fender American Ultra Stratocaster MN Ultraburst**.
    - **Price (Gross)**: Set the price to 1190€. The net price will be automatically calculated based on the selected standard tax rate.

    After entering these details, click **Save**. You’ve now created your first product in its simplest form. At this point, you might notice additional tabs at the top of the page—these will be explored in future lessons, so you can ignore them for now.

2. **View the Product in the Storefront**: Now head to your storefront in the other browser tab. You do not see the product? Perfect, perfect. We can now learn that a product must be assigned to a category to be shown.

3. **Assign to category**: Let's fix that and assign the product to the **Stratocasters** category. Return to the administration tab, still showing the product detail page. Scroll down to **Visibility & Structure**, and under **Categories**, select **Stratocasters** from the tree (click > to expand!). Click **Save** afterwards.

4. **Final check**: Switch back to your storefront and refresh the page. The Product is now shown in the Category, as well as all parent categories up to **Home**.
