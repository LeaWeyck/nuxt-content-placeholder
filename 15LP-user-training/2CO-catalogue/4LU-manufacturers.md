# Manage manufacturers

Let’s now quickly cover the **Manufacturers module**, which plays a crucial role in your shop’s context. Manufacturers, or brands as they are often referred to by customers, are a significant pillar of the value you are selling. Strong brands can greatly influence sales success, so leveraging a well-known brand can be a powerful asset for your shop.

Shopware allows you to effectively describe a manufacturer with rich text, a logo and a link to the manufacturer’s website. This feature helps you present the brand effectively to your customers.

### Adding a Manufacturer

To add a manufacturer, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to Manufacturers**: Go to **Catalogues** and then select **Manufacturers**. Initially, you will notice that there are no manufacturers listed. Click on **Add Manufacturer** to create a new one.
2. **Enter Manufacturer Details**:
    - **Name**: Enter the name of the manufacturer. For this example, let’s use **Fender**.
    - **Website**: Add the manufacturer’s website URL, such as [**http://www.fender.com**](http://www.fender.com/).
    - **Logo**: To add the manufacturer’s logo, click the tree dots next to the logo field, choose **Upload file from URL**, and enter the URL of the logo image, which is https://assets.spotlight.fender.com/logos/fender-red-large.jpg.
    - **Description**: You can also add a description of the manufacturer. While this description won’t be visible in the default product page layout, you can customize your layout to include an “About the Brand” section just below the product description if desired.
3. **Save and Assign**:
    - Click **Save** to finalize the manufacturer’s details.
    - Return to the product you previously created. For the **Manufacturer** field, select **Fender** from the drop-down list and click **Save** again to update the product.
4. **Check the Storefront**:
    - Go back to your storefront browser tab and hit **Refresh** (F5). You should now see that the product is associated with the Fender brand.
    - Clicking on the Fender brand link will open their website in a new browser tab, allowing customers to learn more about the manufacturer.

By associating your products with a well-known brand like Fender, you benefit from the strong brand recognition and trust that the manufacturer brings.

Note that, as we will learn later, customizing the shopping experiences will also enable you to use the name, description, logo and link of the manufacturer wherever you wish in a dynamic fashion!
